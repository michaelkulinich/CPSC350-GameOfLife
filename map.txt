Tree:
1)Ask user if they want to provide a map file
  or if they would like a random assignment
  -If random assignment, prompt for the dimensions of world
    then prompt for decimal value of initial pop density, randomly generate cell
  -if user wants to provide a map file
    prompt user for file path

2) Ask user which of the following 3 modes they want to return
  -Classic
  -Doughnut
  -Mirror

3) should the map class generate the map and run the simulation
int** a = new int*[rowCount];
for(int i = 0; i < rowCount; ++i)
    a[i] = new int[colCount];

CLEAN UP
for(int i = 0; i < sizeY; ++i) {
    delete [] ary[i];
}
delete [] ary;



for(int i = 0; i < columnDimension+2; ++i){
  myGrid[0][i] = myGrid[rowDimension-1][i];
  myGrid[rowDimension-1][i] = myGrid[1][i]
}
